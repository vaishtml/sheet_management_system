### Sheet Management System

This n8n workflow automates the process of reading an unstructured class schedule and distributing personalized timetables to individual mentors.

## Problem Statement
This project is based on real-life problem.
In our college, Mentors all use the same fixed sheet with the full schedule.
The sheet includes date, hall number, class name, and mentor assigned.
Mentors have to constantly check this sheet.
They create separate personal sheets manually, which is repetitive and time-consuming.

I have created a google form and shared it with my mentors, where they addressed their concerns. Using this data, I have narrowed it down to the most common problem they face.

To import the template into your n8n, you can import the json file in the github and see the live workflow.
